<p>Web developers are the ones who code to develop a technical piece of stuff which is then displayed over the Web using HTTP Protocol. Web Designers are completely different from Web Developers. For example A web designer has a knowledge of Adobe Photoshop, Basic HTML to convert the PSD file into HTML, and also CSS but most of the case they concentrate on PSD and HTML. For as a Web Developer looks after the dynamic behaviour of the design (created by web designer) and SERVER-SIDE process using advanced language such as PHP, MySQL, Perl, Python etc. So when it comes to web server there are lot of options available out there but the major ones are Linux, Windows &amp; Mac. Linux is the most used web server from all around world. So it is essential for a web developer to learn Linux.</p>

<p>I hope you might have guessed what I am discussing today… Yes I will be discussing on the importance of Linux for a Web Developer.</p>

<p>I started coding or developing websites from 2009 when i was 19 years old and have gained a lot of experience over the last 3 years in my work and technology which we rely on. As all does i did start coding basically in a windows machine and finally I have settled down with Linux operating system. Well my favourite distribution which i use is Fedora (Red hat based) in laptop and Windows7 Ubuntu (Debian based) in Desktop.</p>

<p>I guess many of you developers has experienced this drastic change in their day to day coding life. Well I am here to discuss my experience as a developer which i faced during these years that might benefit you in some or the other way. The five most important facts that every web developer has to accept for smooth work flow:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stable system</li>

<li>Time saving</li>

<li>Money</li>

<li>Periodic backup</li>

<li>Project management</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1_stable_system">1. Stable system</h3>

<p>Your system should always be up to date with latest updates, bug fixes and patches, If not then you are vulnerable to external threats like virus, network intrusion, system hacking etc. Stability of Windows operating system</p>

<p>Windows is the most used operating system globally, As of August 2012 83.8% of computer users around the world use windows (Source– w3schools) for their day to day needs. Unfortunately it is also vulnerable as it has its reputation, unless you don’t have a copy of genuine windows operating system with proper updates and strong anti-virus which can defend against external threats. Its easy to use in nature and it is based on “Microsoft Disk Operating System” in short “MS-Dos”. It is certainly stable but with TOC apply :) Stability of Linux operating system :</p>

<p>Linux is the third most used operating system globally, (well 2nd used is mac (8.7%) and its out of our scope even though its very popular next to windows) around 5% of computer users around the world use Linux for various purpose to satisfy their needs. Yes we are among these 5% users who are willing to come out of windows fever to explore more features in an open source community. Now a days even Linux operating systems are gaining mileage to come on top of windows or mac through programmers &amp; developers who love open sourcing. Earlier Linux or nix operating system was a nightmare for computer users who were willing to jump to open source community but modern world is gaining lot of changes to make life lot simpler and Linux is one among them. Modern Linux distributions include a desktop environment instead of traditional shell prompt for a Linux distribution, which makes new users to get started easily with few steps though the real power of Linux is experienced only through shell commands (Terminal). It will be a best operating system for a web developer or programmers once if you understand it and learn most of its commands.</p>

<h3 id="2_time_saving_and_money">2. Time saving and Money</h3>

<p>Time is the most valuable resource than anything else on this planet earth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“If Bill Gates drops a thousand-dollar bill, he need not even bother to pick it up, because it would take him 4 seconds to pick it up, he would’ve already earned it back”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a developer you don’t prefer to spend time on cleaning an infected system or to scan external devices each and every time when you insert it into your machine. If you are a windows user you are most likely to face a problem of restarting your system again and again if you just have installed or un-installed any software’s. Scanning your 500 GB hard drive for detecting potential threats could be waste of your precious time. Time saving on windows:</p>

<p>Time saving on windows is much relatively equal to cooking food by burning match sticks. As a windows user I have seen lot of time getting wasted everyday to keep myself well organized. I have even faced system crashing now and then because of heavy software’s which were full filling my needs gradually resulting in slower system which was driving me crazy. If you value time as a web developer then definitely this operating system is not your choice. Time saving on Linux:</p>

<p>Being very less popular because of its lacking user friendly behaviour Linux or any nix operating system with popular desktop environment like GNOME or KDE can save a lot of time. Since you don’t have to worry about virus any more in Linux ( Even though there are few virus for Linux the ratio is like 1 out of 1000 ). Most of the task (A-Z) can be carried out in terminal making life lot more easier. You can even automate the process of software updating, OS upgrading, backing up data of whole system with just a single shell scripting file (which resembles like “linux.sh”). Unbelievable? but this is the fact and real power of Linux. You may face troubles as new user to Linux but you don’t have to worry about it because you can find number of irc channels, forums, wiki’s, blogs etc.. to help.</p>

<h3 id="4_periodic_backup">4. Periodic Backup</h3>

<p>Since no operating system can give you 100% assurance that it is 100% stable and nothing will happen to your valuable data. Hence periodic backup is a good habit for every computer users and most importantly for web developers if you are carrying out any business then data backup is a must following habit. Periodic backups in windows:</p>

<p>Windows has an inbuilt backup utility to backup entire system which some times may not be successful because of some or the other errors which are very common in windows. Best way for making sure that your data is secure is by copying all the necessary documents files and folders into an external hard drive or to use any cloning utility such as Norton ghost. During my days when i was using windows i had a huge data lose when i trusted their inbuilt backup utility. But then onwards till i started using Linux I was copying all my folders to external hard drive and naming it properly with backup date and version number.</p>

<p>Periodic backups in Linux:</p>

<p>Linux is very good, in fact the best as far as my experience for backing up any data or whole installed operating system along with your data. It works 100% fine. Trust me I haven’t faced data failure during backup and restore process from past 3 years. That’s the real power of Linux.</p>

<h3 id="5_project_management">5. Project Management</h3>

<p>If you are a web developer who is carrying out lot of projects along with a team just like me then it is important to manage and track your projects to provide feed backup or support to your clients. Its a very good habit to be followed by every developer to spend some time on managing and organizing your projects accordingly. This is independent of operating system and can be carried it in almost all operating system but Linux have some additional features through its command line utility to keep track of the projects. (Which i will be discussing clearly in a separate episode)</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h4>

<p>Its not about which operating systems or software’s are the best in the tech world but instead what is essential to complete your work easily is all that matters.</p>

<p>If you are a not a developer and an ordinary windows user who spend couple of hours in front of the system for checking mails and to manage some documents then definitely Linux is not a choice for you. You can achieve your goals with windows operating system itself which is far better for a basic user and that is why its a leading operating system from many decades because of easy to use GUI.</p>

<p>If you are a web developer who is willing to change for making your task much more easier and to make couple of extra bucks during this saved time for additional projects, Then Linux is the best choice for you.</p>
